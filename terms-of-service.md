#Terms of Service

Thank you for using CloudApp.  These terms of service constitute a binding agreement and govern your use of CloudApp and access to CloudApp’s websites, including  getcloudapp.com, my.cl.ly, and cl.ly web sites (the "service").  By using any of CloudApp’s (“we” or “us”, and includes Aluminum.io, Inc.) services, or accessing any of our websites, you are agreeing to be bound by the following terms of service.

If you are entering this agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you are representing that you have the authority to bind that entity, its affiliates, any all users who access our services through your account.  In that case, the terms “you” or “your” refer to the company or legal entity, and the users associated with them.  If you don’t have the authority, don’t agree to these terms and conditions on behalf of a company or other legal entity.

If you don’t agree with these terms of service, don’t accept the terms, and don’t use the services.

We have the right to update and change the terms of service from time to time without prior notice. Any new features that augment or enhance the current service, including the release of new tools and resources, shall be subject to the terms of service. Continued use of the service after any such changes shall constitute your consent to such changes. You can review the most current version of the terms of service at any time [here](https://github.com/cloudapp/policy/blob/master/terms-of-service.md).

Violation of any of the terms below will result in the termination of your account. While we prohibit certain conduct and content on the service, you understand and agree that we cannot be responsible for the content posted on the service and you nonetheless may be exposed to such materials. You agree to use the service at your own risk.

###Privacy

provide your legal full name, a valid email address, and any other information requested in order to complete the signup process.

You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. 

We cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
Your login may only be used by one person - a single login shared by multiple people is not permitted. You may create separate logins for as many people as your plan allows.

You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your account (even when content is posted by others who have accounts under your account).

One person or legal entity may not maintain more than one free account.

You may not use the service for any illegal or unauthorized purpose. You must not, in the use of the service, violate any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not limited to copyright or trademark laws).

###API Terms

You may access your CloudApp account data via an API (Application Program Interface). Any use of the API, including use of the API through a third-party product that accesses the service, is bound by these terms of service plus the following specific terms:

We shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from your use of the API or third- party products that access data via the API.

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to CloudApp via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account's access to the API.  We will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API, in our sole and absolute discretion. We will make a reasonable attempt via email to warn you prior to suspension.

We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, your access to the API (or any part thereof) with or without notice.

###Payment, Refunds, Upgrading and Downgrading Terms

Free accounts are not required to provide a credit card number.

All paid plans must enter a valid credit card. You will be immediately billed upon upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan. For any upgrade or downgrade in plan level, your credit card that you provided will automatically be charged the new rate on your next billing cycle.

The Service is billed in advance on a monthly or annual basis and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months or years of service, upgrade/downgrade refunds, or refunds for months or years unused with an open account. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and you shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties.

Downgrading your service may cause the loss of content, features, or capacity of your account. We are not liable for any such loss.

###Cancellation and Termination

You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account. You can cancel your account at any time by visiting http://my.cl.ly/account/delete. The screen provides a simple no questions asked cancellation link.  An email or phone request to cancel your account is not considered cancellation. 

All of your content will be immediately deleted from the service upon cancellation. This information can not be recovered once your account is cancelled.

If you cancel the service before the end of your current paid up month, your cancellation will take effect immediately and you will not be charged again.

We have the right, in our sole discretion, to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the service for any reason at any time. Such termination of the service will result in the deactivation or deletion of your account or your access to your account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all content in your account. We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

###Modifications to the Service and Prices

We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the service (or any part thereof) with or without notice.

Our prices, including but not limited to monthly subscription plan fees, are subject to change upon 30 days notice. Such notice may be provided at any time by posting the changes to the CloudApp websites or the service itself.

We shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the service.

###Copyright and Content Ownership

We claim no intellectual property rights over the material you provide to the service. Your profile and materials uploaded remain yours. However, if you set your content to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view your content.

We do not pre-screen content, but we have the right (but not the obligation) in our sole discretion to refuse or remove any content that is available via the service.

You agree to defend us against and hold us harmless from any claim, demand, suit or proceeding made or brought against us by a third party alleging that your content, or use of the service in violation of these terms, infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property rights of a third party or violates applicable law, and shall indemnify us for any awarded damages and our reasonable attorney’s fees incurred in connection with any such claim, demand, suit or proceeding; provided, that we (a) promptly give you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (b) give you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases us of all liability); and (c) provide you reasonable assistance, at your expense.
